This is a repository for the Source Code of "Fredbear and Friends Revelation." 
Blueprints are not part of this due to some complications.

This game uses a private plugin which contains a lot of core functionality.
Some of the systems and classes you see in this repo are based on that.

Plugins needed in some parts of the source code:
[Narrative 3](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/narrative-quest-and-dialogue-editor),
[Expressive Text](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/expressive-text),
[Pulldown Builder](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/pulldown-builder),
[Logic Driver Lite](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/logic-driver-lite)
